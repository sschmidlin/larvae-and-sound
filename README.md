#Comparison of the effects of reef and anthropogenic soundscapes on oyster larvae settlement

This repository is a collection of the data and the scripts necessary to reproduce the results of the paper: 

Schmidlin, S., & Parcerisas, C.., Hubert, J.,  Watson, M.S., Mees, J., Botteldooren, D., Devos,  P., 
Debusschere, E., & Habl√ºtzel, P.I., Navigating soundscapes: Attractant effect of reef sound on oyster 
settlement may be attenuated by vessel noise. Submitted to Scientific Reports in Februrary 2024.

The folder data/ contains several files: 
* sound_data.xlsx: data from settlement counts
* sound_data.csv: csv version from sound_data.xlsx ready to produce plots 
* model_output.csv: output obtained from the model. This csv is obtained by running the "larvae and sounds.R script"
* results_spl_original_files.csv: acoustic features computed directly from the field recordings. This csv is obtained 
by running the sound_exposition_analysis.py script
* results_spl.csv: acoustic features computed on the 1-h recordings in the lab. 
This csv is obtained by running the sound_exposition_analysis.py script

The folder sound_processing_python/ contains several scripts: 
* compare_test_with_recorded.py: this script was used to decide the volume of each playback
* process_sound_files.py: script to downsample/upsample all the selected files 
* sound_exposition_analysis.py: script to analyze the differences in spectrum and acoustic features between field and 
lab recordings per treatment (produces Figures 4 and 5)


The scripts in the main folder are: 
* larvae and sounds.R: script to compute the main statistics of the paper (produces Table 1)
* plot_model_results.py: script to produce a scatter plot from the model output (Figure 3)


The folder figures/ contains the obtained figures for the results of the paper.

The wav files used for the exposure experiment will be available on the Marine Data Archive (MDA).
